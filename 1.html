  <h2>Who are they? 그들은 누구인가?</h2>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age" target="_blank" title="The elderly definition">Old age</a> refers to ages nearing or surpassing the life expectancy of human beings, and is thus the end of the human life cycle. Terms and euphemisms include <strong>old <u>people</u> (worldwide usage)</strong>, seniors (American usage), senior citizens (British and American usages), older adults (in the social sciences[1]), the elderly, and elders (in many cultures—including the cultures of aboriginal people).

  </p><p style="margin-top:45px;">Old people often have limited regenerative abilities and are more susceptible to disease, syndromes, and sickness than younger adults. The organic process of ageing is called senescence,[2] the medical study of the aging process is called gerontology,[3] and the study of diseases that afflict the elderly is called geriatrics.[4] The elderly also face other social issues around retirement, loneliness, and ageism.[5]</p>
